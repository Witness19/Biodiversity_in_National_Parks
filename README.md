# Biodiversity In National Parks

## Project Description

In the "Biodiversity in National Parks" project, we dive into the fascinating world of biodiversity using two fictional datasets that closely resemble real-world biodiversity data. With Python and powerful data manipulation tools like Pandas and Matplotlib, we analyze species distribution, conservation status, and park-specific observations over a 7-day period. Despite the limited data collection period and absence of historical data, our analysis yields clear insights. To enhance future analysis, including timestamps for observations and obtaining historical data beyond the 7-day period would create a more comprehensive dataset, improving the accuracy of predictive modeling and analysis.

## Key Findings

### Biodiversity by Park

- Yellowstone National Park stands out with the highest biodiversity, recording the most observations across all categories, particularly for birds and vascular plants.
- Bryce National Park and Yosemite National Park also exhibit significant biodiversity, especially in the vascular plant category.

### Category Insights

- "Vascular Plant" observations dominate in all parks, indicating abundant and well-documented plant life.
- "Birds" are the most frequently observed category, highlighting a significant presence of bird species.
- "Mammals" also show substantial presence, particularly in Yellowstone and Bryce National Parks.

### Park Comparisons

- Great Smoky Mountains National Park offers a balanced representation of various species, despite not having the highest overall counts.
- The distribution of observations across categories follows a consistent pattern across all parks, reflecting natural biodiversity patterns.

### Patterns of Interest

- The "Fish" category has relatively low observations compared to other categories, suggesting less frequent study of fish species.
- There are unique biodiversity profiles for each park, with Yellowstone National Park leading in observations, while Great Smoky Mountains National Park offers balanced diversity.

## Visual Insights

### Observation Disparities

We visually compared the total number of observations across various parks. The findings reveal significant disparities:

- Yellowstone National Park leads with 1,443,562 observations.
- Great Smoky Mountains National Park records the lowest with 431,820 observations.

These insights shed light on the parks with varying levels of observation activity.

### Conservation Status by Category

- Birds are the most common category with the "Species Of Concern" conservation status.
- Fish exhibits the lowest count of species in this conservation status.
- In the "Threatened" conservation status category, Fish leads, while Mammals are most frequent in the "Endangered" category.
- Birds are the sole category represented in the "In Recovery" conservation status.

The visualization vividly illustrates the distribution of species categories within the dataset, providing valuable insights into the park's biodiversity.

## Conclusion

This analysis informs conservation efforts and encourages further research into the ecosystems of these national parks. Each park has a unique biodiversity profile, with Yellowstone National Park leading in the sheer number of observations, and Great Smoky Mountains National Park offering a balanced diversity of species. These findings are essential for understanding and preserving the natural treasures of our national parks.
